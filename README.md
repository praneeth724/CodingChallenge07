👋 I'm thrilled to share a coding challenge I recently worked on to enhance my game development skills. 🕹️ In this challenge, I created a simple game scenario with two game objects. The magic happens when one game object collides with the other:



✨ Collision Magic:

  - 🔄 The second game object disappears seamlessly.

  - 🔊 A delightful sound effect plays, adding a touch of audio satisfaction.

  - 📝 A console message is printed to let you know what just happened.



👨‍💻 Tech Stack:

  - Language: C#

  - Library/Framework: Unity

  - Sound Library: Pixabey
